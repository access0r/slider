in which the contract is registered with a service that provides verification and consistency as an itermediary after
an audit and onward to deployment on mainnets (a vavlidation of contracts essentially--to ensure nothing is changed and is made aware of any upgradeable proxy contracts..etc)

provides a unnique KEY ad IV every time the page is served for verification.
